          "inside of your nose.Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available "
          "to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once"
          " the laboratory receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your sample at home – either a swab from "

          "When someone gets COVID-19, their body usually makes antibodies. However, it typically takes one to "
          "three weeks to develop these antibodies. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people "
          "may not develop antibodies. A positive result from this test may mean that person was previously infected with the virus. "
          "Talk to your healthcare provider about what your antibody test result means.Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose "
          "COVID-19. To see if you are currently infected, you need a viral test. Viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples,"
          " such as swabs from the inside of your nose."
